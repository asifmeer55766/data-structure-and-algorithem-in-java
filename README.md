# Data Structures and Algorithms in Java.

## Overview

This repository documents my complete journey of learning **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Java**, starting from absolute basics and progressing to advanced problem-solving techniques. The goal of this repository is to build strong fundamentals, improve logical thinking, and prepare for technical interviews and real-world problem solving.

All code is written in **Java**, well-structured, and pushed regularly to track progress and maintain consistency.

## Purpose of This Repository

- To learn DSA **step by step from beginner to advanced level**
- To strengthen problem-solving and analytical thinking
- To maintain a **clean and organized GitHub portfolio**
- To prepare for **coding interviews, competitive programming, and software engineering roles**
- To revise concepts easily through structured code and notes

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Java
- **IDE:** VS Code
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
- **Platform:** YouTube + (LeetCode, HackerRank etc.)
